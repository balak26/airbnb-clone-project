## 🧰 Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern full-stack architecture to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. Below are the core technologies and their roles in the Airbnb Clone Project:

### ⚙️ Backend

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It simplifies rapid development, handles server-side logic, and supports RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs used instead of traditional REST. It allows the frontend to request only the data it needs, improving performance and flexibility in data exchange.

### 🗃️ Database

- **MySQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage structured data such as users, bookings, listings, reviews, and payments.

### 🔐 Security & Authentication

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used to securely authenticate users and manage session tokens. It enables stateless, scalable authentication.

- **HTTPS**: Ensures encrypted communication between the client and server, protecting sensitive user data during transmission.

### 🧪 DevOps & CI/CD

- **GitHub**: Used for version control and team collaboration. It allows developers to manage code changes, pull requests, and track issues efficiently.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool that automates testing, linting, and deployment pipelines to ensure continuous integration and delivery.

- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.

- **Cloud Hosting (e.g., AWS, Heroku)**: Provides scalable infrastructure for deploying the application to staging and production environments.

### 🖥️ Frontend (Optional/Extendable)

- **React** *(suggested)*: While not covered in the initial scope, React can be used to build the frontend interface that interacts with the GraphQL API.
